      <p>
         1. Wendy Fullerton is 60-something retired choir teacher who is living in Preston, Idaho with her husband of 45
         years. She spends several hours a day on her iPad, giving lots of time and attention to a cappella videos on
         YouTube and to her coloring app. She would like to get out of the house more, both for social fulfillment and
         for the exercise. She has also recently noticed that her two dogs are getting chubby and need to be taken on
         more walks. Wendy has begun to check the weather daily in order to prepare for her outdoor excursions and has
         been using the internet to get recommendations for community activities.

         2. Clark Magpie just turned 40 years old and is living in Soda Springs, Idaho with his family. He has recently
         reloacted to this small Idaho town after spending most of his life in metropolitan areas. When he is not
         working or serving in his church, he is helping his wife raise and entertain 4 girls and 2 boys (twins). Clark
         is a country boy at heart and is thrilled to now have the outdoors at his front door! He is looking forward to
         taking his kids fishing, snowmobiling, hiking, and spelunking in Caribou County. Clark relies heavily on his
         smartphone to keep track of all his work and church responsibilities, so that is usually how he accesses the
         internet for other business and leisure as well. He plans to use his phone multiple times a week to check the
         weather and coordinate his outdoor adventures accordingly.
