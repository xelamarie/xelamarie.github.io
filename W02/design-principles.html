               "The time to reach the target depends on the distance to the target and its size. The bigger the icon or
               a button, the easier it is to reach it." - Fitts' Law
               </br>
               </br>
               Users go to Zillow to search for homes. Having a large, obvious search box front and center when you land
               on their home page is a great example of Fitts' Law.

            <h3>Visual Heirarchy</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-b">
               Visual hierarchy is a pattern in the visual field wherein some elements tend to "stand out," or attract
               attention, more strongly than other elements, suggesting a hierarchy of importance.
               </br>
               </br>
               The first thing you’re drawn to in the design of Simply Chocolate's website is the huge text that
               explains what the product is all about. This is done in a way that doesn’t detract from the other
               elements on the screen.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Featuring <a href="https://www.everyplate.com/weekly-menu" target="_blank">EveryPlate</a></h4>
            <img class="img-c" src="images/everyplate.jpg" alt="EveryPlate" />
            <p class="paragraph-c">
               "The time required to reach a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices." - Hick's
               Law
               </br>
               </br>
               EveryPlate does a great job of using Hick's Law to not overwhelm the customer with choices. Each week,
               customers are assigned preselected meals. While they are able to edit these choices, there are still only
               about 12 to choose from. The limited choices, combined with the meal picture tiles, makes this a visually
               appealing and user-friendly website.
